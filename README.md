# Control blur effect on lockscreen

GNOME V42 and above now please use [lockscreen-extension](https://github.com/PRATAP-KUMAR/lockscreen-extension).
lockscreen-extension is a improved version where you can set your preferred background as a color or image and adjust blur from the lockscreen itself.
